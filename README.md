ISSUES:
1. explicit search display on google search under automation.py under the function GoogleSearch()
2. links do not work with PlayYouTube() under automation.py
3. language model shifting problem(basic hindi is not working, voice commands not working on terminal)
4. image generation is still under work, only 1 or 2 stable outputs


FEATURES ARE INDIVIDUALLY WORKING, THE FRONTEND IS UNDER PROGRESS, TO ACCESS ALL THE FEATURES WE HAVE TO RUN PROGRAMS UNDER backend folder MANUALLY ONE BY ONE FOR EACH OF THE FEATURES

COLLECTIVE WORKING IS UNSTABLE, SO IT IS SHELVED FOR NOW.

CHECK requirements.txt FOR THE LIBRARIES USED.
